This cyberpunk Rainmeter suite is composed of two skins, the navBar and networkStatus. Use the Nav bar to navigate to your most popular programs or use the middle mouse function on the games icon to reveal a hidden set of icons to your favorite games. The network status graphic will give you real-time information on the status of your favorite game servers, websites, and devices on your local network.
